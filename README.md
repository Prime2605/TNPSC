## 🌈 Design Philosophy

The design of **Subashini** is centered around the concept of **"Motivating Aesthetics"**. We believe that a beautiful tool encourages usage.

- **Colors**: A rich palette featuring 'Deep Purple', 'Neon Gold', and 'Hot Pink' to incite energy and focus.
- **Motion**: Subtle micro-interactions and animations (hover effects, progress fills) make the interface feel alive.
- **Clarity**: High contrast text and clear hierarchy ensure learning materials are legible and accessible.
